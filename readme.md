#Rashba SOC: measuring Chern number

###Theory/simmulation tasks
* Is chern number really 1/2?
* For Ramsey: what is the effect of having small Rabi frequencies on the second pulse? (there is data for this as well)
* When loading, why do thermal clouds land in different position than BECs? --> look at amplitude of eigenstates
* Berry curvature is infinite at one point and zero otherwise, what do I do about this?
* 

###Data analysis tasks
* Thermal cloud reconstruction algorithm.
* Fits to TDSE evolution with full Hamiltonian.
* Probe cleaning algorithms:
	* Fourier filterning?
	* Digital refocusing?
	* Does fringe removal work well with images taken at different times?
* Data postselection: remove BEC shots and shots with small atom numbers.
* 3D visualization of data
* Relliable way of locating Dirac point in data?
